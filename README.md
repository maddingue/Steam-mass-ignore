# Name
Steam-mass-ignore - Userscript for ignoring Steam apps en masse

# Description
Steam has too many games, and not enough features to filter them out. One
can ignore a game, but their DLC still have to be manually ignored. Pretty
annoying for games with hundreds of DLC.

This userscript tries to somehow fixes that by walking the DLC shown on
a game page and executing the web request to ignore each of them.

This userscript should work with either
[GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/),
[ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or
[Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
